# Frontend Skill & Aesthetic Execution Guidelines

His skill enables the creation of **distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces** that deliberately avoid generic “AI-slop” aesthetics.  
The focus is on **real, working code** with **exceptional attention to aesthetic detail and creative intent**.

---

## Input Context

The user provides **frontend requirements**, which may include:

- A component, page, application, or complete interface
- Context about:
  - Purpose
  - Target audience
  - Technical or performance constraints

---

## Design Thinking (Before Writing Any Code)

Before implementation, **commit to a bold and intentional design direction**.

### 1. Purpose
- What problem does this interface solve?
- Who is the primary user?
- What emotional response should it evoke?

### 2. Tone (Choose an Extreme)
Pick **one strong aesthetic direction** and fully commit to it:

- Brutally minimal
- Maximalist chaos
- Retro-futuristic
- Organic / natural
- Luxury / refined
- Playful / toy-like
- Editorial / magazine
- Brutalist / raw
- Art-deco / geometric
- Soft / pastel
- Industrial / utilitarian

> Inspiration is allowed. Indecision is not.  
> The goal is **intentionality**, not moderation.

### 3. Constraints
- Frameworks (React, Vue, Vanilla, etc.)
- Performance budgets
- Accessibility requirements
- Browser/device support

### 4. Differentiation
Ask:
> **What is the one unforgettable thing someone will remember about this UI?**

This could be:
- A signature interaction
- A bold layout choice
- A unique typographic moment
- A dramatic motion sequence

---

## Implementation Requirements

The resulting frontend must be:

- **Production-grade and fully functional**
- **Visually striking and memorable**
- **Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view**
- **Meticulously refined down to spacing, motion, and micro-details**

---

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

### Typography
- Choose **characterful, expressive fonts**
- Avoid generic choices:
  - ❌ Inter
  - ❌ Roboto
  - ❌ Arial
  - ❌ System fonts
- Prefer:
  - A distinctive **display font**
  - A refined, readable **body font**
- Typography should *lead* the design, not decorate it

---

### Color & Theme
- Commit to a **cohesive palette**
- Use **CSS variables** for consistency
- Favor:
  - Strong dominant colors
  - Sharp, intentional accents
- Avoid:
  - Timid palettes
  - Evenly distributed colors
  - Overused purple-on-white gradients

---

### Motion & Interaction
- Motion must feel **designed**, not decorative
- Prefer **CSS-only animations** for HTML
- Use **Motion libraries** (e.g., Framer Motion) for React when appropriate

Focus on:
- One powerful **page-load sequence**
- Staggered reveals (`animation-delay`)
- Scroll-triggered effects
- Hover states that *surprise*

> One memorable animation > ten forgettable ones

---

### Spatial Composition
- Reject predictable layouts
- Embrace:
  - Asymmetry
  - Overlapping elements
  - Diagonal flow
  - Grid-breaking components
- Use:
  - Generous negative space **or**
  - Controlled, intentional density

---

### Backgrounds & Visual Detail
Create **atmosphere and depth**:

- Gradient meshes
- Noise or grain overlays
- Geometric patterns
- Layered transparencies
- Dramatic shadows
- Decorative borders
- Custom cursors (when justified)

Avoid defaulting to flat solid colors unless conceptually aligned.

---

## Hard Rules (Non-Negotiable)

- **NEVER** use generic AI-generated aesthetics
- **NEVER** reuse the same fonts, palettes, or vibes across generations
- **NEVER** converge on trendy defaults (e.g., Space Grotesk everywhere)
- **EVERY DESIGN MUST FEEL CONTEXT-SPECIFIC**

---

## Complexity Matching

- **Maximalist designs** → elaborate code, layered animations, rich visuals
- **Minimalist designs** → restraint, precision, perfect spacing, subtle motion

Elegance is not simplicity —  
**Elegance is correct execution of intent.**

---

## Final Reminder

Do not hold back.

This work should demonstrate what’s possible when:
- Taste is sharp
- Decisions are confident
- Aesthetic vision is executed with discipline

**Think like a designer.  
Build like an engineer.  
Ship like it matters.**
